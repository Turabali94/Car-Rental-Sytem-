# List of Requirements:
To compile this we need any c++ compiler like visual studio or dev c++
# Data Structures (With Justification) 
I have used singly linked list because elements can be easily inserted or deleted and we can increase of decrease the list size at runtime this way there is no memory wastage.
 #File Handling
All data of linked list goes to file and is save for future use and we have used text file in this project and we can retrive data from this text file
